## How to Play

Clone the repository and open it up in Unity. Connect your VR headset to your computer and allow unknown sources to connect to Unity.

Click the Play button in Unity and grab your controllers. When you put on the headset, you will see the bowling alley and the bowling ball next to you.

You can move around in the space with the left joystick and interact with objects with the grab triggers. Pick up the ball now!

Above the lane, you will see your score out of 10 for each round. There are nine frames in a full game, so your max score is 90!

Throw the ball (make sure your wrist straps are on!) underhanded at the pins. Once all of the pins have settled, hit the big red button on the table.

This will reset the ball and pins to start the next round. Once you have completed nine rounds, the game is over and you can start a new one.

Thanks for playing!
